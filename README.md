# Smart Contract Audit Pool

## Overview
A decentralized platform built on Clarity smart contracts that enables transparent contract review and security validation processes. This project implements staking, voting, and continuous audit mechanisms to improve smart contract security.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Staking Module**: Handles deposit and withdrawal of stake
- **Audit Registry**: Tracks and manages contract audit status
- **Voting System**: Enables collective decision making on proposed changes
- **Reward Distribution**: Manages incentive distribution for auditors

### Smart Contracts
1. `stake-pool.clar`: Manages staking operations
2. `audit-registry.clar`: Tracks audit submissions and history
3. `vote-engine.clar`: Handles voting logic
4. `reward-dist.clar`: Controls reward distribution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet (Clarity development environment)
- NodeJS v14 or higher
- (Optional) Stacks Wallet for testing

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/smart-contract-audit-pool

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local test environment
clarinet develop
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
clarinet test

# Run specific test suite
clarinet test tests/stake-pool-test.ts
```

## Security Considerations

### Risk Mitigation
- Multiple signature requirements for critical operations
- Time-locked operations for stake withdrawals
- Rate limiting on sensitive functions
- Emergency pause functionality

### Audit Process
1. Initial code review submission
2. Community review period
3. Professional audit verification
4. Continuous monitoring phase

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Clarity best practices
- Document all public functions
- Include detailed error messages
- Add comprehensive test coverage

### Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch
3. Submit pull request with tests
4. Request review from maintainers

## Technical Documentation

### Smart Contract Functions

#### Staking Operations
```clarity
;; Stake deposit function
(define-public (stake-tokens (amount uint))
    (begin
        ;; Implementation details
    )
)
```

#### Audit Submission
```clarity
;; Submit audit report
(define-public (submit-audit (contract-id uint) (report-hash (buff 32)))
    (begin
        ;; Implementation details
    )
)
```
